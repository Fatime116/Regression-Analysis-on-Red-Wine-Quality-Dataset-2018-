# Regression-Analysis-on-Red-Wine-Quality-Dataset-2018-


Research Objective : To develop a model estimating the quality of wine based on various predictors. Data source :

Red wine dataset we used for our project is from UCI Machine Learning Repository

(http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality)

Data Description:

Experts conducted physicochemical tests (e.g. pH values and acidity... ) on the red wine samples from the north of Portugal and made an evaluation based on the median of 3 wine experts according to their sensory levels and each expert graded the wine quality between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).

The predictors we used in our project:

Response Variable: Wine Quality

Predictor Variables : fixed acidity, volatile acidity ,citric acid ,residual sugar, chlorides ,free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, Density, pH ,sulphate, alcohol.
